    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to forcast whether the price will rise or fall tomorrow. Some individuals attempt to predict the exact price, but this approach has a significant flaw. While my model might excel at precisely estimating the price, it can still result in financial losses. This is because my primary concern, when engaging in stock trading, isn't achieving accuracy in the precise price, but rather in accurately determining the direction of movement whether the price will increase or decrease. Therefore, my aim is to ascertain whether, on days when the stock price rises, we can accurately anticipate this upward trend. This knowledge enables informed stock purchases, centered around predicting whether the stock will ascend or descend. For this project S&P500 stock dataset was downloaded using Yahoo Finance.Once I have the dataset I can tidied invalid data, dropped the duplicated data, use the insights from EDA and create feature selection on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addressing this classification challenge, my efforts encompass the creation of six distinct prediction models. Additionally, an ensemble model, amalgamating Random Forest, Decision Tree,SVM and regression approaches, is devised. Evaluating the models across multiple metrics, including accuracy,precision and others, reveals that the VotingClassifier has comparble performance with other models.Moreove, I conducted backtesting as a crucial step to assess the algorithms' performance over several years of historical data.I introduced supplementary features into the dataset and to explore the algorithms comprehensively, I adjusted the prediction horizons and analyzed rolling means. The model, now enhanced with these new features, exhibits a notable 57% precision in predicting upward movements in stock prices during purchase instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, financial markets are inherently noisy and subject to unpredictable events, making accurate prediction a challenging endeavor. Careful feature engineering, robust model evaluation, and continuous monitoring are crucial to building a reliable prediction model in this domain.Plus we need to regularly validate its accuracy against actual market movements and adjust the model as needed to improve its predictive capabilities."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The project's domain background:\n",
    "Exploring the dynamic realm of the finance sector unveils the remarkable potential of machine learning. Extensively researched and well-documented, this arena entices us with substantial monetary rewards, motivating us to harness mathematical and statistical models to decode stock movement patterns. This pursuit grants us an advantageous edge, enabling us to anticipate market trends and outpace fellow traders. In the contemporary landscape, a multitude of trading brokers capitalize on high-frequency financial data and cutting-edge electronic trading tools, all underpinned by the principles of machine learning. These high-frequency traders epitomize speed, rapid turnovers, and formidable order-to-trade ratios, progressively supplanting conventional traders (Aldridge I., 2013). Remarkably, the bedrock of buy and sell indicators primarily rests on historical price and volume data, diverging from conventional company valuation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of my present limitations in comprehensively assessing a company's intrinsic worth and conducting stock valuations, I've discerned the realm of stock price prediction as an exceptionally fitting focus of study. Data acquisition from \"Yahoo! Finance\" underpins this endeavor. The typical structure of historical data for the S&P stock index from \"Yahoo! Finance\" encompasses Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Dividends, and Stock Splits. However, a close examination reveals that the volume feature is subject to loose recording, rendering it notably unreliable and impractical for rigorous analysis. The S&P500, an index gauging the stock performance of 500 major US-listed corporations, constitutes our focal point. I intend to construct a machine learning model that forecasts the forthcoming S&P500 price index using historical data, and subject this model to backtesting across over two decades of historical data. This extensive timeframe, spanning from 1990 to the present, ensures the project's analysis retains meaningful depth and validity, solidifying our confidence in the predictions it produces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "To initiate the process, I begin by importing the 'yfinance' package, thereby summoning the 'yfinance' API for the acquisition of daily stock index prices. Subsequently, I proceed to instantiate the ticker class, a pivotal component facilitating the retrieval of historical price data for a specific symbol. For the scope of this project, the symbol of choice is 'GSPC,' synonymous with the S&P 500 index.\n",
    "\n",
    "MY trajectory continues as I invoke the 'history' method, designating the 'period' parameter as 'maximum.' This strategic selection compels the query to encompass data from the inception of the index, ultimately furnishing us with a structured pandas data frame. Each entry within this data frame corresponds to the price on a singular trading day, effectively excluding non-trading days. The columns of this data frame bear significance, denoting the opening price at market commencement, the zenith and nadir of prices throughout the day, the closing price at market closure, and the aggregate volume traded during the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Central to my endeavor is the utilization of these columns in prognosticating the future directional movement of stock prices – whether they ascend or descend. Notably, the data frame encompasses supplementary columns named 'Dividends' and 'Stock Splits.' It is important to elucidate that these particular columns are not integrated into our analysis. Their pertinence is more pronounced within the context of individual stocks, rather than in the domain of index price forecasting."

    "#### Training an initial machine learning model\n",
    "\n",
    "With the dataset now prepared, I am poised to initiate training for the machine learning model. To embark on this journey, I've opted to employ the RandomForestClassifier as my primary choice. This preference is rooted in several compelling reasons. First and foremost, the RandomForestClassifier operates through the training of multiple distinct decision trees, each characterized by randomized parameters. The subsequent amalgamation of outcomes from these trees engenders a mitigation of overfitting tendencies. Although overfitting remains a potential concern, its manifestation is notably subdued in comparison to alternative model architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the RandomForestClassifier boasts a commendable pace of execution, rendering it an efficient candidate for my purposes. Furthermore, its adeptness in capturing non-linear trends within the data renders it particularly suited for my venture. Take, for instance, the relationship between the opening price and the target variable,this connection isn't confined to linear correlation. The RandomForestClassifier's capacity to discern and account for such intricate non-linear dependencies aligns seamlessly with the multifaceted nature of stock price prediction, where non-linearity often pervades the underlying relationships.

    "Within this model, an increased count of trees serves to diminish the model's variability. The parameter 'n_estimators' delineates the quantity of trees within the forest, and the default value of 100 proves adept in its performance within this context. My pursuit involves experimentation with varying 'n_estimators,' guided by recommendations found in literatures. Elevating the count of trees enhances the model's data comprehension capabilities. However, it's crucial to manage the trade-off with 'max_depth.' To mitigate the potential overfitting risk associated with a higher 'max_depth,' I adhere to a value of 10. This choice aligns notably well, particularly in scenarios where feature dimensions are constrained."

    "- This holds significant importance within the realm of machine learning. It's crucial for us to evaluate whether our model aligns with our intended outcomes. Specifically, the precision score comes into play. It gauges the accuracy of our predictions when we anticipated the market to rise (designated as 1). Essentially, it quantifies how often our predictions of market growth were accurate. This metric proves particularly effective in this context, given our presumption that we aim to purchase stocks and retain them until their value appreciates before selling. Therefore, it's imperative that the stock price ascends upon purchase. Depending on our objectives, we can modify the choice of error metrics to assess performance. For this project, I will be employing precision, accuracy, and the F1 score for evaluation."

As anticipated, the linear kernel manifested the least favorable performance. Subsequently, I iteratively explored kernels like sigmoid and rbf before delving into the polynomial kernel. An interesting observation emerged wherein logistic functions, being a subset of sigmoid functions, yielded comparable outcomes akin to those of logistic regression and the sigmoid kernel. This guided my trajectory toward adopting the polynomial function as the kernel of choice.\n",

    "### 7. Ensemble Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The ensemble approach involves assembling four individual models into an array known as 'estimators,' which serves as the foundation for constructing a voting classifier. This voting classifier takes a pair of inputs: the first input being the array of estimators that encompasses the four models. The fundamental principle behind a voting ensemble is to aggregate predictions generated by classification models through summation or by averaging predictions from regression models. Additionally, it provides us with the flexibility to adjust parameters for the SVM model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the initial phase, I configured the voting parameter to 'hard,' guiding the classifier to make straightforward predictions. However, through research, I came to realize that utilizing 'soft' voting often yields superior performance compared to hard voting. This is attributed to the heightened significance placed on highly confident votes. The key distinction lies in the approach: 'soft' voting involves summing the predicted probabilities for each label. To simplify, while 'hard' voting predicts the majority label, 'soft' voting predicts the label associated with the highest predicted probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon implementing 'soft' voting for the model, I observed a modest enhancement in its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the refined ensemble model in place, I will proceed to train it using the training data and subsequently evaluate its performance on the testing data."

Subsequently, I will establish the ratio between today's closing price and the closing price during these designated periods.

    "## Summary and next steps with the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, I arrived at the conclusion that the ensemble model yields results comparable to those of the other models. Drawing on the outcomes outlined above, we discern that the model enriched with new features demonstrates a 57% precision in predicting upward shifts in stock prices during purchase instances. This achievement stands commendable, especially given the context of relying solely on time-series data and historical index prices. Notably, due to computational limitations, neural networks, particularly recurrent ones like Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks tailored for time-series data, were omitted from consideration in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the research question at hand, there remains substantial room for advancement. Expanding the dataset could yield improved predictions by leveraging factors such as Twitter sentiment or economic indicators to enhance the assessment of whether stocks will trend upward or downward. Although this project is not exhaustive, it serves as a foundational analysis for future endeavors. The array of machine learning models crafted throughout this journey, some of which were novel to me, significantly contributes to potential future work. Overall, this project has been enlightening, providing insights into various model workings, even though the predictive accuracy regarding stock trends proved less satisfactory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, time limitations prevented the exploration of alternative methods of feature engineering, such as incorporating classic stock market indicators. To enhance the model, it is recommended to integrate exchanges operating overnight. While the S&P 500 trades only during US market hours, other global indices commence trading before the US market opens. Exploring correlations between these indices and the S&P 500 could potentially yield valuable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this marks the culmination of the first phase of the project. The forthcoming second stage will delve into exploring the aforementioned avenues for improvement. It is crucial to acknowledge, however, that predicting financial markets, including stock prices like the S&P 500, is a formidable and intricate undertaking. Financial markets are influenced by an extensive array of variables, encompassing economic indicators, geopolitical occurrences, investor sentiments, and other unpredictable elements. Thus, consistently achieving high-accuracy stock price predictions remains a challenging endeavor."
